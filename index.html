            <p>Someday, I'll be livin' in a big old city
              And all you're ever gonna be is mean
              Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
              And all you're ever gonna be is mean
              Why you gotta be so mean?</p>

              As the lights go down
              Gimme something that'll haunt me when you're not around

              I thought I had you figured out
              Something's gone terribly wrong
              You're all I wanted
              Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
              I thought I had you figured out

              Can't turn back now, I'm haunted</p>

              Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
